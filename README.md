Dirsync is a command-line utility for synchronizing files across directories,
either one-way from the source directory to the target one, or two-way,
synchronizing symmetrically across two source directories.
The program supports detailed control over conflict resolution, verbosity, and dry-running.
Additional directory-specific configuration is supported, saved in the directories themselves
in a local config file.
